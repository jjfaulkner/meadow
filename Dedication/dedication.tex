\textbf{Moonset}.

The light flows thin through the midnight air from a misty milky lamp\\
As blinking stars weave through the sky: a blanket of cool and damp.

The humble mushrooms raise their heads to worship the silver light\\
And bathe in beams and rays of gold, cutting the fabric of night.

“T-woo” says an owl who silently swoops through the tops of the dew-dropped trees\\
The anonymous call rolls round the folds of hills, carried by the hands of the breeze.

The dim glow of morning fills whispy clouds, interrupted by the flash of a lark\\
The silhouettes of the trees now mark the horizon, standing proud as the sky fades from dark.

Back to the burrow for the sleepy mole, as the nights ebbs gently away\\
His whiskers, thin glints in the waning light, brush softly on his bed of hay.

“Farewell” to the light, which, to the new day, yields;\\
The restful moon sinks gracefully down in front of the dawn-drenched fields.
