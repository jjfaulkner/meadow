\chapter{Cosmos}

To understand the origin of understanding, we must first understand the origin of chaos.

% some theme about unprovable truths

This story begins a long time ago, at the very beginning of everything.
I do not know how long ago this was, for time itself had not yet gained the meaning it has now.
For time to have meaning, there must be change: change in position, in state, in form: for things which are to stop, and things which are not to begin.
But at the beginning, nothing was not: there only was.
Everything was in a state of undifferentiated unity.

An endless soup: matter and energy in a formless void, swirling, coalescing, inter-exchanging and transforming from one to the other.
A cauldron of stuff, extending across the entirety of the baby \foreignlanguage{greek}{κόσμος}; a fine balance of creation and destruction so violently dynamic that its only prevailing feature is its absence of features.
This formless state is the \foreignlanguage{greek}{χάος}.
Though formless, it is not nothing: it is everything.
Everything that will ever be, could ever be, was in this \foreignlanguage{greek}{χάος}.

What came before the \foreignlanguage{greek}{χάος} is not a matter of importance.
